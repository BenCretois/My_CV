With hand-on experience with R, Python, multiple GIS softwares and with a strong interest in statistics and machine learning I am very interested in the Data Scientist position you are offering and I would be thrilled to be part of your team at NINA.

I believe a good understanding of data is critical to finding solutions to the current biodiversity and climate crises we are facing. NINA is clearly aware that knowledge production is hindered by the diversity of data and metadata standard and, as shown by the Living Norway initiative, NINA is leading the way towards healthier biodiversity databases. I would love to be part of this effort aiming at tackling challenges in data use and develop my knowledge of data science with your team.

Visualizing, wrangling and analyzing data have been a critical part of my PhD where I developed solutions to better use unstructured dataset coming from large databases such as GBIF and Artsdatabanken. Curious about new technologies and methods, I am currently studying image recognition algorithms with Keras. I should also add that I am learning Norwegian, as I wish to stay in Norway.
Finally, working together implies understanding each other. Collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams and teaching statistics at master level improved my ability to convey complex concepts to a wide range of audience. 

I thank you very much for your attention and I really look forward to hearing from you soon.
